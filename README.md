# 📊 Smart Advertising Using Machine Learning

Smart Advertising is a machine learning-based web application designed to improve online ad targeting and user engagement. By analyzing user behavior, ad content, and interaction history, the system delivers personalized ad recommendations in real-time, maximizing click-through rates and marketing ROI.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build a recommendation engine for personalized ad targeting
- Use user profiles and behavioral data to improve ad relevance
- Predict ad click-through rates using classification models
- Incorporate user feedback (likes, dislikes, clicks) into learning loop
- Provide a user-friendly web interface for interaction and feedback

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, TF-IDF
- **Database**: MySQL or SQLite
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 💡 Key Features

- User registration and login system
- Dynamic ad display and click tracking
- Real-time click prediction using ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- TF-IDF based content filtering for ad similarity scoring
- User feedback integration for refining recommendations
- Dashboard to visualize performance metrics

## 🔍 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and structure ad metadata, user demographics, and interaction logs.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Encode user profiles, ad content, and behavior patterns.
3. **Model Training**: Train ML models to predict ad clicks using labeled interaction data.
4. **Recommendation Engine**: Match ads to users based on TF-IDF similarity and predicted click probabilities.
5. **Evaluation**: Measure model accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-advertising-ml.git
cd smart-advertising-ml
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### 3. Set up the database

* For MySQL: Import `adsystem.sql` using phpMyAdmin or CLI
* For SQLite: Use `sqlite3` with the included schema

### 4. Run the app

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

## 📁 Project Files

* `app.py`: Main Flask backend
* `ads_model.pkl`: Trained ML model for click prediction
* `templates/`: HTML templates for user interface
* `static/`: CSS and JS files
* `utils.py`: TF-IDF and recommendation logic
* `adsystem.sql`: MySQL database schema and sample data

## 📊 Sample Use Case

A 25-year-old male user interested in tech clicks on several smartphone ads. The system:

* Records click behavior
* Scores similar ads using TF-IDF
* Predicts high CTR ads for similar users
* Recommends new ads accordingly

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Deep learning-based recommendation system (e.g., collaborative filtering)
* A/B testing integration
* Admin analytics dashboard
* Real-time ad bidding simulation
